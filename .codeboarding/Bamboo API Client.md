## Component Details

This graph illustrates the architecture of the Bamboo API Client, which facilitates interaction with the Bamboo CI/CD API. The core functionality revolves around the `Bamboo API Client` component, which leverages the `REST Client Core` for all HTTP communications. The `Bamboo Internal Helpers` component provides utility functions to assist the `Bamboo API Client` in processing API responses, particularly for pagination and list handling. The overall purpose is to provide a comprehensive and easy-to-use Python interface for managing various aspects of Bamboo, including projects, build plans, branches, build results, deployments, users, groups, permissions, agents, and reports.

### Bamboo API Client
This component provides a high-level interface for interacting with the Atlassian Bamboo REST API. It includes methods for managing projects, plans, builds, deployments, users, groups, agents, and plugins, abstracting the underlying HTTP communication.
