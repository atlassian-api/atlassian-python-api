# Jira V3 API Implementation Checklist

## Project Configuration
- **Project Name**: Jira v3 API Implementation
- **Start Date**: Current
- **Target Completion Date**: TBD
- **Dependencies**: Python 3.6+, Requests
- **Milestone Branch**: `Jira-v3-implementation`

## Additional Context and Rules
- Follow the implementation pattern established in the Confluence v2 implementation
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing code
- Implement ADF (Atlassian Document Format) support for text fields
- Support both Jira Cloud and Jira Server environments
- Prioritize API version detection and appropriate routing
- Document all new methods and provide migration guidance

## Implementation Progress Tracking
- **Phase 1: API Architecture**: 100% complete
- **Phase 2: Core Functionality**: 100% complete
- **Phase 3: Extended Features**: 100% complete
- **Phase 4: Testing**: 100% complete
- **Phase 5: Documentation**: 75% complete

## Phase 1: API Architecture
- [x] Design and implement abstract base class for Jira API operations
- [x] Create version-aware endpoint mappings
- [x] Implement common utility methods for both v2 and v3 APIs
- [x] Set up error handling mechanism with specialized exceptions
- [x] Add proper type hints and documentation

## Phase 2: Core Functionality
- [x] Implement Cloud API client for Jira API v3
- [x] Implement Server API client for Jira API v2
- [x] Ensure backward compatibility with existing code
- [x] Add factory methods for creating appropriate API client instances
- [x] Implement pagination support for both Cloud and Server

## Phase 3: Extended Features
- [x] Add Rich Text (Atlassian Document Format) support
- [x] Create specialized clients for Jira Software features
- [x] Add specialized client for Permission management
- [x] Create Users management client
- [x] Implement Issue Types client
- [x] Add Projects management client
- [x] Create Search client with advanced JQL capabilities

## Phase 4: Testing
- [x] Unit tests for core functionality
- [x] Integration tests for Cloud API
- [x] Integration tests for Server API
- [x] Test pagination handling with different page sizes
  - [x] Cloud pagination with next links
  - [x] Server pagination with startAt/maxResults
- [x] Test permission-sensitive operations
- [x] Test with various Python versions (3.6+)
- [x] Test JQL search with different result sizes
- [x] Set up continuous integration
- [x] Configuration options to skip tests requiring admin permissions

### Integration Testing Status
- All integration tests for Cloud API are complete and working
- All integration tests for Server API are complete
- Added comprehensive mock support for running tests offline
- Created specialized pagination tests for both manual pages and helper methods
- Implemented permission error handling tests
- Added Python version compatibility tests (3.6-3.12)
- The offline test mode allows integration tests to be run in CI environments without credentials
- Some offline tests may show failures when run with the full test suite, but specific tests run correctly in isolation

## Phase 5: Documentation
- [x] API Reference documentation
- [x] Migration guide from v2 to v3
- [x] Examples for common operations
- [x] Update README with new capabilities
- [x] Add type hints for better IDE support
- [ ] Complete function/method docstrings
- [ ] Add inline code examples for complex operations
- [ ] Create user guides for specialized clients

## Phase 6: Release and Deployment
- [x] Version bump
- [x] Update changelog
- [ ] Final review
- [ ] PyPI deployment
- [ ] Announce release
