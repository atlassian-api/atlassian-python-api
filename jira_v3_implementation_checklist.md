## Integration Test Status

Integration testing showed partial success with several issues:

1. **Working Tests**:
   - User authentication and basic user operations
   - Getting all projects and basic project information
   - Issue type and field retrieval
   - Rich text document creation and conversion
   - Board operations in Jira Software

2. **Tests Requiring Attention**:
   - Project-specific operations (404 errors - project key not found)
   - Issue creation and management (400 errors - possibly due to project configuration)
   - Permission-sensitive operations (403 errors - access denied)

3. **Next Steps for Testing**:
   - Create detailed documentation on test requirements (permissions, project setup)
   - Add configuration options to skip tests requiring admin permissions
   - Update test data to support varied Jira configurations
   - Create sanitized test data generator

## Phase 4: Testing
- [x] Unit tests for core functionality
- [x] Integration tests for Jira Cloud
- [ ] Integration tests for Jira Server
- [x] Mocking infrastructure for offline testing
- [ ] Test with different Python versions (3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10)
- [ ] Continuous integration setup

## Phase 5: Documentation
- [ ] Method-level docstrings
- [ ] Migration guide from v2 to v3
- [ ] Examples
- [x] README updates
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Changelog
