# Examples and apps

Here you can find different examples of how to use a library.

You can use it as a reference for your apps or just use it "as is" for your needs.
Feel free to send us new examples if you think, that we miss something important.
There are simple rules each example should follow:

* **Do not store** any credentials in VCS
* Do not use any additional dependencies except the python build-in's
* Follow the PEP-8 and format your code.

JetBrains PyCharm built-in formatter is perfectly fine and used a lot at this library
