Create the **Commit Header** with the relevant Service Name pre-fixed, examples below,

* [JIRA] Issues Move to Sprint       :heavy_check_mark:
* Confluence: update_page_property method     :heavy_check_mark:

An example of a commit message header,

* Addition of parameters for start & limit in the function of `get_all_project_issues`      :x:

merging/review process has been completed. To do this you can install it
